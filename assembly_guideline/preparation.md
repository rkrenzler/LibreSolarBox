# Assembly Workshop at the Fablab St.Pauli, 08. July 2018

### Preparation Steps
- Software tools
  - FreeCAD, 
- Prepare tools and place
-> foto of each part
  - table
  - crimping tool
  - screwdriver: Tools Sechscantschlussel, Torx 15, Torx 25, Posidrive S2
  - side cutter
  - allen wrench
  
  First remove part with socket. To get access to fuse
- Prepare material and components
  - Frame and Housing (in this case UniProKit)
    - screws, nuts
    - T-slot alu profile
    - 3D printed corner elements / connectors
    - bottom plate
    - housing plates
  - Battery pack
    - 3D printed battery case (bottom and cap -> download link to file)
    - battery cells
    - cell connectors
  - electrical components
    - Libre Solar components -> MPPT, *BMS*, (optional: CAN2Wifi)
    - (optional: RaspberryPi0)
    - wires - power wires (6 sq mm), balancing wires (2 sq mm)
    - ferrules, cable lugs
    - (optional: communication wire - ethernet cable)
   - plugs
     - *dc-output plugs (car plug, 2x)*
     - solar input plugs (WeidmÃ¼ller PV Stick allows assembly w/o crimping and is compatible to MC4. Clips should be removed that the plug can be unmounted without tools)
     - *usb plugs*
     - *ON/OFF switch, pushbutton, integrated LED*
     - (optional: RJ45 jacks (2x))
     - (optional: epaper display+conncetion wire)

Remarks: Parts in *italic font* still need to be ordered.
## Disassembly ##
### Disconnect BMF: ###
* Remove FUse
* BAT+
* BAT-
* Klebe not-isolated cable parts.
* Remove PWR+ cables.
* Isolate metal end.
* Remove PWR- cable
* Isolate metal end.
* Remove cable from PWR+ of BMS
* Remove Cable from PWR- 
* Remove thin cables 
* Remove interent cables
* Remove monitor cables
* Shift cables down. Keep them away from Batteries
* Remove thin cable
### Remove upper part of the case
* Remove screws from upper plending.
* Remove screews from handle. Because the handle connects the upper blending with the frame.
* Remove upper blending with the handles.
### Remove the blending with interface ###
Interface are the sockets on the wall.
* Remove thick cables from blending if they are not soldered.
* Remove screws from the blending. Put them into a cup.
* Desolder on/off- swich.
* Remove CAN SOcket
* Remove USB power socket
* Remove two DC Out 1V Socket
* Do not remove PV INPUT and OUTPUT from interface. In this version it is not mechanically possible yet. We need to disconnect them from MPPT first.
* Remove PV Input and OUTPUT cables from MPPT.
* Remove all other cables from MPPT.
* Remove the interface bleding.
* Remove PV Input and OUTPUT sockets with cables. Now it is possible.


(For future vesion, use different cable color for different socket
### Assembly Steps
1. Frame assembly
- 1.1 nuts into t-slot profile (

//comment from Oliver: fotos, which shows for each side the placement (and numbers) of the nuts (sitting in the slots). This is the key-information needed when assembling a box the first time, in order to avoid repeatedly re-opening the frame for adding some forgotten nuts


- 1.2 place profile in rectangle, place corner elements between profiles, screw together
- 1.3 repeat 
- -> result: 2 connected rectangle frame
- 1.4 connect the 2 rectangle frames with profile
- -> result: boxframe
2. screw bottom plate on bottom side of boxframe
- -> result: boxframe with bottom plate
3. cut and crimping wires
- 3.1 ...
4. battery pack assembly -> !!!!!safety note!!!!!
- 4.1 put battery cells in battery case (bottom part)
- 4.2 connect battery cells together
- 4.3 connect balancing wires with cells
- 4.4 connect power wires with battery cells
- 4.5 screw battery pack with bottom plate
5. mouting of electric components
...

### Disassembly Steps
1. remove blending parts (sides, backs)
-> pic box, mark sides, mark screws
2. remove fuse! -> no voltage/ current in system, note for electric safety rules 
-> pic fuse
3. remove interface (plugs, swith), by cutting, by 
-> pic interface, mark points to remove
4. remove cables from electric components
-> pic components, pic interface/jack
5. demount electric parts
-> pic screws
6.
